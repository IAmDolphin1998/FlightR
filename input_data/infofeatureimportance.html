	    What is Feature Importance?
	  </strong>
	  <p>
	    Feature Importance refers to techniques that calculate a score for all the input features for a given model — the scores simply represent the “importance” of each feature. A higher score means that the specific feature will have a larger effect on the model that is being used to predict a certain variable.
