	    What is the Silhouette Coefficient?
	  </strong>
	  <p>
	    The silhouette value is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). The silhouette ranges from âˆ’1 to +1, where a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters. If most objects have a high value, then the clustering configuration is appropriate. If many points have a low or negative value, then the clustering configuration may have too many or too few clusters. This score is <strong>(b-a)/max(a,b)</strong> where <em>a</em> is the average intra-cluster distance (i.e the average distance between each point within a cluster) and <em>b</em> is average inter-cluster distance i.e the average distance between all clusters.

	  <p>
	   The silhouette can be calculated with any distance metric, such as the Euclidean distance or the Manhattan distance.
