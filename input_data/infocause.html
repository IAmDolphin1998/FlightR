	    The airlines report the causes of delay in broad categories that were created by the Air Carrier On-Time Reporting Advisory Committee.  The categories are Air Carrier, National Aviation System, Weather, Late-Arriving Aircraft and Security.  The causes of cancellation are the same, except there is no late-arriving aircraft category.
	  </p>
	  <p><strong>How are these categories defined?</strong></p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <strong>Air Carrier:</strong> The cause of the cancellation or delay was due to circumstances within the airline's control (e.g. maintenance or crew problems, aircraft cleaning, baggage loading, fueling, etc.).

	    <li>
	     <strong>Extreme Weather:</strong> Significant meteorological conditions (actual or forecasted) that, in the judgment of the carrier, delays or prevents the operation of a flight such as tornado, blizzard or hurricane.

	    <li>
	      <strong>Late-arriving aircraft:</strong> A previous flight with same aircraft arrived late, causing the present flight to depart late.
