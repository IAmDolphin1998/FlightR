	  <strong>What is a Correlation Matrix?</strong>
	  <p>
	    A correlation matrix is simply a table which displays the correlation coefficients for different variables. The matrix depicts the correlation between all the possible pairs of values in a table. It is a powerful tool to summarize a large dataset and to identify and visualize patterns in the given data.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    A correlation matrix consists of rows and columns that show the variables. Each cell in a table contains the correlation coefficient.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In addition, the correlation matrix is frequently utilized in conjunction with other types of statistical analysis. For instance, it may be helpful in the analysis of multiple linear regression models. Remember that the models contain several independent variables. In multiple linear regression, the correlation matrix determines the correlation coefficients between the independent variables in a model.

	  <p>So, there are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      To summarize a large amount of data where the goal is to see patterns.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      To input into other analyses.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      As a diagnostic when checking other analyses.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
